# Parallel Queue Enhancement

## Current Queue System (Sequential)

The current queue processes operations one at a time:

```typescript
// Current: Sequential processing
for (const operation of sortedQueue) {
  await executeChainOperation(
    operation.chainId,
    operation.type,
    operation.amount
  );
}
```

## Enhanced Queue System (Parallel)

We could enhance the queue to support parallel execution:

```typescript
// Enhanced: Parallel processing
const processQueueParallel = useCallback(async () => {
  if (state.isProcessingQueue || state.operationQueue.length === 0) {
    return;
  }

  setState((prev) => ({ ...prev, isProcessingQueue: true }));

  try {
    // Group operations by chain to maintain order per chain
    const operationsByChain = groupBy(state.operationQueue, "chainId");

    // Execute all chains in parallel
    const chainPromises = Object.entries(operationsByChain).map(
      async ([chainId, operations]) => {
        // Within each chain, execute operations sequentially (approval → deposit)
        for (const operation of operations.sort(
          (a, b) => a.priority - b.priority
        )) {
          await executeChainOperation(
            operation.chainId,
            operation.type,
            operation.amount
          );
        }
      }
    );

    // Wait for all chains to complete
    await Promise.all(chainPromises);
  } finally {
    setState((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      isProcessingQueue: false,
      operationQueue: [], // Clear completed operations
    }));
  }
}, [state.isProcessingQueue, state.operationQueue, executeChainOperation]);
```

## Benefits of Parallel Queue

1. **Faster Execution**: Multiple chains process simultaneously
2. **Maintained Order**: Approval → Deposit order preserved per chain
3. **Better UX**: Reduced total wait time
4. **Granular Control**: Still shows per-chain states
5. **Error Isolation**: One chain failure doesn't stop others

## Implementation Considerations

### Chain Switching Challenge

The main challenge with parallel individual operations is chain switching:

- **Current**: Switch chain → Execute → Switch chain → Execute
- **Parallel**: Multiple operations need different chains simultaneously

### Solutions

1. **User Confirmation**: Ask user to stay on current chain during parallel execution
2. **Smart Grouping**: Group operations by current chain, execute those first
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Fall back to sequential if chain switching needed

## Hybrid Approach

Best of both worlds:

```typescript
const processQueueSmart = async (
  mode: "sequential" | "parallel" = "parallel"
) => {
  if (mode === "parallel") {
    // Try parallel execution
    try {
      await processQueueParallel();
    } catch (error) {
      // Fall back to sequential if parallel fails
      console.warn("Parallel execution failed, falling back to sequential");
      await processQueueSequential();
    }
  } else {
    await processQueueSequential();
  }
};
```

## When to Use Each Mode

### Parallel Queue (Proposed Enhancement)

- ✅ Multiple chains with independent operations
- ✅ User wants fastest execution with granular control
- ✅ All operations can proceed without chain switching issues

### Sequential Queue (Current)

- ✅ Chain switching required between operations
- ✅ User wants to see step-by-step progress
- ✅ Debugging or troubleshooting scenarios

### Batch Operations (Existing)

- ✅ Simple parallel execution without granular control
- ✅ Production-ready, tested approach
- ✅ When you don't need per-chain operation visibility

# Multi-Chain Vault Frontend Challenge

## Overview

Your task is to build a modern Web3 frontend application that interacts with our SimpleVault smart contract deployed across multiple EVM chains. This assignment will test your ability to create a seamless multi-chain DeFi experience with a focus on user experience and technical excellence.

## Smart Contract Details

The SimpleVault contract is already deployed on the following networks:

- **Sepolia** (Ethereum testnet)
- **Sei Testnet**

Contract Functions:

- `deposit(address token, uint256 amount)` - Deposit USDC into the vault
- `withdraw(address token, uint256 amount)` - Withdraw USDC from the vault
- `getBalance(address user, address token)` - View user's vault balance

## Technical Requirements

### Required Technologies

- **Framework**: React or Next.js (14+ recommended)
- **Web3 Libraries**: wagmi + viem
- **Wallet Connection**: Your choice (RainbowKit, ConnectKit, Web3Modal, etc.)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Any UI libraries
- **State Management**: Your choice (Zustand, Redux, Context API, etc.)

### Core Features

1. **Wallet Connection**

   - Support for multiple wallet providers
   - Display connected address and network
   - Network switching functionality

2. **Multi-Chain Dashboard**

   - Display user's USDC balance (wallet and vault) across all supported chains
   - Show total portfolio value aggregated across chains
   - Network status indicators

3. **Multi-Chain Batch Operations** ‚≠ê (Key Feature)

   - Allow users to input deposit amounts for multiple chains simultaneously
   - Single "Execute Batch" button that initiates the deposit sequence
   - Guide users through each transaction with clear status updates
   - Handle transaction failures gracefully with retry options
   - Example flow:

     ```
     User inputs:
     - Sepolia: 100 USDC
     - Sei Testnet: 50 USDC

     ‚Üí Click "Execute Batch Deposit"
     ‚Üí Step 1/4: Approve USDC on Sepolia
     ‚Üí Step 2/4: Deposit on Sepolia
     ‚Üí Step 3/4: Approve USDC on Sei Testnet
     ‚Üí Step 4/4: Deposit on Sei Testnet
     ‚Üí ‚úÖ Batch operation complete!
     ```

4. **Transaction Management**

   - Real-time transaction status updates
   - Transaction history (at least last 10 transactions)
   - Links to block explorers

5. **Withdrawal Interface(optional)**

   - Withdraw funds from any supported chain
   - Input validation based on vault balance
   - Transaction confirmation

## Bonus Features (Optional)

- Withdraw funds from any supported chain
- Gas estimation for each transaction
- ENS name resolution
